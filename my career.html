                    <p>The inspiration behind the reason I'm pursuing a BSIT course is that I'm aiming to  
                    become a <span><strong>website designer</strong></span> upon completing my college education. This 
                    determination developed during my senior high school year as I got exposed to  
                    gadgets because of the pandemic. At first, I wasn't really good at it. However, 
                    during this time, I eventually found joy in designing my digital activities, PowerPoint presentations, and even our group's website, thinking that I wasn't skilled 
                    enough at that time. On the other hand, my creativity improved as I gained a proper of 
                    designing using various digital tools. I enjoyed that part that eventually I'm slowly 
                    learning it and realizing that I'm already good at designing digital works and have 
                    gained new strength. <br> <br>
                    Another <span><strong>strength</strong></span> I'm capable of lies in adaptability, considering that in the field 
                    of IT, there is a constant innovation of new ideas and technologies. Nonetheless, I
                    acknowledge certain <span><strong>weaknesses</strong></span>, particularly in terms of limited knowledge, time 
                    constraints, and a lack of experience. Being at the rapid pace of advancement in
                    the world of technology, my journey might be difficult, particularly in learning 
                    the use of various coding languages. But with my continuous learning and involvement 
                    in different activities related to my course, I view these shortcomings as 
                    opportunities for growth, and I have a strong will to transform them into my strengths.
